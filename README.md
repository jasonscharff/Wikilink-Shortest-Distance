Shortest Distance Between Two Wikipedia Articles
==========================

Given two Wikipedia articles this program scrapes Wikipedia to use a Breadth First Search to find the shortest distance between the two articles using only hyperlinks. The final output is an array tracing the path taken. It's the equivalent of a bacon number for wikipedia.
